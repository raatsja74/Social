# To-Do List

- [x] Review project requirements — documented the ingestion goals in the project README.
- [x] Set up development environment — captured repeatable setup steps in the project README.
- [x] Explore existing `rag` module structure — audited the ingestion pipeline and mapped dependencies.
- [x] Implement data ingestion improvements — added file-pattern filtering, dry-run support, and optional dependency fallbacks.
- [x] Add automated tests for ingestion pipeline — introduced unit coverage for collection, ingestion, and metadata helpers.
- [x] Update documentation with new workflow — refreshed module usage docs and added a repository overview.
